# Implicit Type Conversion in VBScript Comparisons

This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, error in VBScript stemming from its implicit type conversion during comparisons.  The `bug.vbs` file contains code that exhibits this issue. The `bugSolution.vbs` file provides the corrected version.

**Problem:**
VBScript's implicit type conversion, while convenient, can lead to unexpected behavior when comparing values of different data types. This is particularly problematic when comparing numbers with strings that resemble numbers.

**Solution:**
Explicitly convert variables to the desired data type before comparison to ensure accurate results.  Using the `CInt` or `CDbl` functions, depending on the situation, guarantees consistent comparison outcomes.
